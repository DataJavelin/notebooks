# [ELFI](https://github.com/elfi-dev/elfi) Notebooks

This repository contains tutorials and examples in the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org) format. These should be maintained, so please let us know if something doesn't work with current release of ELFI.

Full documentation can be found at http://elfi.readthedocs.io/. Limited user-support may be asked from elfi-support.at.hiit.fi, but the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/HIIT/elfi?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link) is preferable.
